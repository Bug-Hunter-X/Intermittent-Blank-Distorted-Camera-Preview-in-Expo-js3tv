# Expo Camera Preview Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component.  The camera preview intermittently fails to render correctly, appearing blank or distorted. The issue seems to be related to the way the camera component interacts with the parent component's layout. This repository provides a minimal reproducible example and a potential solution.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe that the camera preview may be blank or distorted, especially after interacting with other parts of the app.

## Potential Solution

A potential solution involves adjusting how the camera component is styled and positioned within the parent layout. The solution provided utilizes specific styling and layout techniques to enhance the consistency of the camera preview rendering.  Further investigation might reveal more robust solutions.
